        <h2>Coconut Fiber Uses:</h2>

        <h3>Agriculture and Horticulture</h3>
        In gardening, coconut fiber is used as:
        <ul class="ulStyle">
          <li>Coco peat (or coir pith) for seed starting and hydroponics.</li>
          <li>Coco chips and coir mulch for soil aeration and moisture retention.</li>
          <li>Coir pots and liners for eco-friendly plant containers.</li>
        </ul>
        It is highly valued in organic farming due to its ability to retain water, improve soil structure, and enhance
        root growth.
        <br><br>

        <h3>Ropes and Twines</h3>
        Coir is traditionally spun into ropes, cords, and fishing nets, especially in coastal regions. It’s naturally
        resistant to saltwater, making it ideal for marine and outdoor use.<br><br>

        <h3>Mattress & Cushion Filling</h3>
        Coconut fiber is often used as a filler in mattresses, pillows, and cushions. The coir provides firm support,
        natural bounce, and allows for excellent ventilation, making it ideal for bedding and furniture padding.
        <br><br>

        <h3>Floor Mats and Rugs</h3>
        The stiff and durable nature of coir makes it ideal for manufacturing household and industrial brushes, mops,
        and brooms. It holds its shape well and is effective for both dry and wet cleaning tasks. <br><br>

        <h3>Brushes and Brooms</h3>
        One of the most recognizable uses of coconut fiber is in coir mats and rugs. These are popular for entryways,
        doormats, and outdoor flooring due to their coarse texture and ability to trap dirt.<br><br>

        <h2>Coconut Fiber Benefits:</h2>

        <h3>Eco-Friendly and Sustainable</h3>

          <li>Coir pots and liners for eco-friendly plant containers.</li>

        <br>
