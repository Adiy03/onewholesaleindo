        <h2>Corn Cob Versatile Uses & Benefits:</h2>

        <h3>a. Industrial Use – Abrasive and Polishing Media</h3>
        Corn cob grit is widely used as a natural abrasive material for cleaning delicate surfaces without scratching or
        damaging them. Because it is soft, corn cob grit is ideal for removing dirt, carbon, rust, and coatings without
        affecting the integrity of the substrate. It is especially effective in:
        <br><br>
        <ul class="ulStyle">
          <li>Sandblasting and surface treatment of metals, plastics, wood, and fiberglass.</li>
          <li>Polishing and deburring precision parts in the automotive, aerospace, and electronics industries.</li>
          <li>Cleaning mold surfaces and engine components where gentle yet thorough abrasion is needed.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <h3>b. Animal Bedding – Clean, Dry, and Absorbent</h3>
        It has excellent moisture and odor absorption properties, is dust-free, and provides a comfortable, hygienic
        environment for animals. For laboratory or veterinary use, it can be sterilized to meet health standards.
        When finely screened and dried, corn cob grit serves as absorbent bedding for animals such as:
        <ul class="ulStyle">
          <li>Poultry</li>
          <li>Small pets (hamsters, guinea pigs, rabbits)</li>
          <li>Reptiles (snakes, lizards)</li>
          <li>Laboratory animals (mice, rats)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>c. Animal Feed Additive – Natural Fiber and Carrier</h3>
        Corn cob grit (in meal form) is often used as a high-fiber feed supplement for ruminant animals like cattle,
        goats, and sheep. Its high cellulose content aids digestion and improves overall feed efficiency. It also serves
        as an inert carrier for:
        <ul class="ulStyle">
          <li>Vitamins and minerals</li>
          <li>Premix formulas</li>
          <li>Probiotics or medication in powdered feed</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>d. Horticulture and Agriculture <br> Soil Amendment and Growing Media</h3>
        Because it breaks down slowly, it helps retain moisture in the soil while supporting microbial activity—ideal
        for organic and sustainable farming systems. In farming and gardening, corn cob grit is used as:
        <br><br>
        <ul class="ulStyle">
          <li>A soil conditioner that improves aeration and drainage</li>
          <li>A component in potting mixes for potted plants</li>
          <li>A base material in organic composting</li>
        </ul>
