        creations.<br><br>

        Frequently incorporated into curries, sauces, soups, and rice dishes.
        It enriches meals with creamy flavor, boosts nutritional value, and adds a tropical twist to both savory and
        sweet recipes.<br><br>

        <h2>Desiccated Coconuts Types:</h2>

        <h3>High Fat – Fine Grade</h3>
        A premium quality desiccated coconut made from the finely grated kernel of fresh, mature coconuts.
        With a high fat content (typically 60–65%), it delivers a rich coconut flavor, creamy mouthfeel, and natural
        aroma. <br><br>

        Its fine texture makes it ideal for confectionery, biscuits, cakes, cookies, chocolates, and as a coating for
        sweets. <br><br>

        <h3>High Fat – Medium Grade</h3>

        Produced from carefully dried and grated mature coconut kernel with high fat content (around 60–65%). <br><br>

        The medium particle size gives a coarser texture, perfect for bakery, cereals, desserts, energy bars, and savory
        dishes where added crunch and flavor are desired. <br><br>

        It retains the authentic taste and aroma of fresh coconuts, making it highly versatile for both household and
        industrial food applications. <br><br>

        <h3>Low Fat</h3>

        Made by mechanically pressing and partially defatting the coconut kernel before drying and grating.
        <br><br>

        With a reduced fat content (typically 45–50% or lower), this variant offers longer shelf life and lower calorie
        content while still maintaining natural coconut flavor. <br><br>

        Widely used in diet-specific food products, health foods, bakery mixes, and processed foods where lower fat is
        preferred without sacrificing quality.
