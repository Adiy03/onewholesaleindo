        <h3>1. Rice Husk Ash (RHA)</h3>
        Rice Husk Ash is a by-product of controlled rice husk combustion, rich in amorphous silica with high reactivity.
        It is widely used in construction, steel, and refractory industries as an eco-friendly alternative to silica
        fume. <br><br>

        RHA is available in two main grades — Normal Carbon and Low Carbon — each offering specific benefits depending
        on the application, from insulation and slag conditioning to technical fillers and cementitious materials.

        <h2>Activated Carbon Uses :</h2>

        <h3>a. Water Purification :</h3> Activated carbon is widely used in drinking water and wastewater
        treatment. It removes chlorine, bad odors, organic pollutants, and other impurities, improving water quality for
        household and industrial use.
        <br><br>

        <h3>b. Air and Gas Filtration:</h3> Used in air purifiers, industrial exhaust systems, and gas masks,
        activated carbon traps volatile organic compounds (VOCs), odors, and toxic gases, making the air safer to
        breathe.
        <br><br>

        <h3>c. Gold Recovery:</h3> In the mining industry, activated carbon plays a key role in gold extraction
        through processes like CIP, CIL, and CIC. Its high adsorption capacity allows efficient recovery of gold from
        cyanide solutions.
        <br><br>

        <h3>d. Food and Beverage Processing:</h3> Activated carbon is used to decolorize, purify, and remove
        unwanted tastes or odors from food and beverages such as sugar, wine, and juices.
        <br><br>

        <h3>e. Medical and Pharmaceutical:</h3> Activated carbon is used in emergency treatments for poisoning and
        drug overdoses, as well as in pharmaceutical manufacturing to purify raw ingredients and products.
        <br><br>

        <h3>f. Chemical Processing:</h3> In chemical industries, activated carbon filters impurities from raw
        materials, recovers solvents, and acts as a catalyst carrier in various reactions.
        <br><br>

        <h3>g. Cosmetics and Personal Care:</h3> Commonly found in facial masks, toothpaste, and soaps, activated
        carbon helps absorb toxins, oils, and impurities from the skin, promoting cleanliness and clarity.
        <br><br>
