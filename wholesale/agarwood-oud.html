              Agarwood Oud
              From Indonesia</h1>
            <br>

            trees native to Indonesia.. <br><br>
          </div>

        </div>

        Widely used in perfumery, traditional medicine, and spiritual practices, Agarwood is crafted into chips, powder,
        and essential oil (Oud oil) to serve diverse global markets. <br><br>

        Its unique scent profile, rarity, and natural origin make Agarwood one of the world’s most valuable raw
        materials, sought after by industries and individuals looking for luxury and authenticity.

        <h2>Agarwood Oud Specifications:</h2>

        <h3>1. Agarwood Chips / Wood Pieces</h3>

        and fragrance, often used in religious ceremonies, meditation, or as a luxury room scent. <br><br>

        The distinct aroma
        profile of each chip depends on its origin, resin content, and age, making them highly collectible and prized in

        Powder form offers versatility, as it can be used for direct burning,
        blending, or as a raw material for oil distillation.

        distillation of Agarwood. <br><br>
