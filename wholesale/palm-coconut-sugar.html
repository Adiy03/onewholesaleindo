            Palm sugar and coconut sugar are traditional natural sweeteners originating from Indonesia <br><br>
          </div>
        </div>

        Both are versatile and widely used in beverages, bakery, confectionery, sauces, and wellness products. They are
        available in powder, block, and syrup forms, including organic coconut sugar and organic palm sugar, meeting
        global demand for alternative sweeteners. <br><br>

        Highly valued for their authentic taste, nutritional benefits, and role as natural sweeteners with a lower
        glycemic index compared to refined cane sugar. <br><br>

        Although often mentioned together, there are subtle differences between the two:

        <ul class="ulStyle">
          <li>Palm Sugar is typically made from the sap of various palm trees, with a deeper caramel-like flavor and
            darker
            color.</li>
          <li>Coconut Sugar, also called coconut palm sugar, is derived from the nectar of coconut blossoms, offering a
            lighter taste profile and slightly higher mineral content, making it a popular choice among health-conscious
            consumers.</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Cooking & Baking:</strong>
        Perfect for sauces, curries, marinades, cakes, cookies, and confectionery.

        Popular in organic, vegan, and health-focused products due to their low glycemic index and natural mineral
        content.
        Often used in energy bars, cereals, and functional foods.<br><br>

        <strong>Industrial Applications:</strong>
