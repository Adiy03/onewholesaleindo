            Seaweed is a natural marine resource harvested from coastal and ocean waters, widely found in tropical and
            temperate regions.

          <p>
            Seaweed grows abundantly in clean seawater environments and is known for its diverse varieties, textures,
            and colors, including green, brown, and red seaweeds.
          </p>

          <p>
            These marine plants are rich in essential minerals,
            vitamins, antioxidants, and natural polysaccharides, making them highly valuable for food, pharmaceutical,
            cosmetic, and industrial applications.
          </p>

          <h3>Types of Seaweed</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Eucheuma Seaweed</strong> – Commonly used as a raw material for carrageenan production. Widely
              applied in the food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries as a natural thickener and stabilizer.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Gracilaria Seaweed</strong> – A primary source of agar, used extensively in food processing,
              laboratories, and biotechnology industries.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Sargassum Seaweed</strong> – Brown seaweed mainly utilized for alginate extraction, organic
              fertilizer production, animal feed, and bioenergy applications.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Ulva (Green Seaweed)</strong> – Often used in food products, animal feed, and agricultural
              fertilizers due to its high nutrient content.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Kappaphycus Alvarezii</strong> – A premium carrageenan-producing seaweed, valued for its high gel
              strength and consistent quality.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            One of the primary uses of seaweed is in the food industry, where it is processed into edible products,
            seasonings, snacks, and functional ingredients.
          </p>

          <p>
            Seaweed is also a key raw material for producing agar,
            carrageenan, and alginate, which are widely used as natural thickeners, stabilizers, and gelling agents in
            food and beverage manufacturing.
          </p>

          <p>
            Seaweed also plays an important role in the pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and agricultural industries. Its
            bioactive compounds are used in supplements, skincare products, organic fertilizers, and soil enhancers due
            to their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and growth-stimulating properties.
          </p>

          <p>
            Due to its sustainability and fast growth cycle, seaweed is considered an environmentally friendly resource.
            It helps absorb carbon dioxide and excess nutrients from seawater, contributing positively to marine
            ecosystem balance.
          </p>

          <p>
            Indonesia is one of the world’s leading producers of seaweed, supported by its extensive coastline, warm
            tropical waters, and ideal marine farming conditions. This ensures a consistent and reliable supply of
            high-quality seaweed for global markets.
          </p>

          <p>
