            available in Indonesia as one of the world’s largest palm producers. <br><br>

            Valued for its high calorific energy, low ash content, and stable supply, PKS is extensively used in biomass
            power plants, industrial boilers, briquette and pellet production, as well as raw material for charcoal and
            <a href="./activated-carbon.html" class="blue">activated carbon.</a> <br><br>

        <h2>Palm Kernel Shell (PKS) Uses:</h2>

        <strong>Biomass Power Generation:</strong>
        PKS is widely used as a renewable fuel for biomass power plants due to its high calorific value and low ash
        content, making it an eco-friendly alternative to coal.<br><br>

        <strong>Industrial Boilers:</strong>
        Commonly used in cement, textile, food, and other industries as a cost-effective solid fuel for steam and heat
        generation.<br><br>

        <strong>Charcoal & <a href="./activated-carbon.html" class="blue">Activated Carbon</a> Production:</strong>
        PKS can be carbonized into charcoal and processed into activated carbon, which is in high demand for water and
        air purification.<br><br>

        <strong>Briquettes & Pellets:</strong>
        Crushed PKS is often compacted into briquettes or pellets as biomass fuel for household and industrial
        applications.<br><br>

        <strong>Soil Amendment & Compost:</strong>
        In agriculture, PKS ash is sometimes utilized as a soil conditioner and nutrient-rich composting
        material.<br><br>

        <h2>Indonesia Palm Kernel Shell Benefits:</h2>

        Indonesia is the world’s largest producer and exporter of palm oil, and also a major supplier of high-quality
        Palm Kernel Shell (PKS). <br><br>

        PKS is a hard, fibrous by-product of palm oil extraction, characterized by its dark brown to black color,
        excellent calorific value, and low ash content. It is widely recognized as a sustainable biomass fuel
        alternative to coal. <br><br>

        Sourced sustainably from palm oil plantations across Sumatra, Kalimantan, and Sulawesi, Palm Kernel Shell from
        Indonesia is extensively used in biomass power generation, industrial boilers, charcoal production, and as raw
        material for activated carbon. <br><br>

        Its renewable nature, cost-effectiveness, and contribution to clean energy make PKS a highly demanded export
        commodity in the global energy market.
