        <h2>Activated Carbon Based for Sale</h2>

        <ul class="ulStyle">
          <li>
            <h3>Coconut Shell Based Activated Carbon</h3>
            Activated carbon made from coconut shell is widely used due to its small pore structure.

            <div class="space"></div>

            This type is highly effective for drinking water purification and gold refining, making it popular in
            industries
            that require high purity
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Wood Based Activated Carbon</h3>
            Wood-based activated carbon has larger pores.

            <div class="space"></div>

            Making it ideal for decolorizing and purifying colored liquids
            such as sugar, syrup, or beverages. Its characteristics help improve clarity without affecting taste
            quality.
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>Coal Based Activated Carbon</h3>
            This type is commonly used in large-scale industries. <div class="space"></div>
            Activated carbon from coal (bituminous or anthracite) is
            widely applied for gas filtration, wastewater treatment, and other heavy-duty applications due to its strong
            adsorption capacity.

          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Activated Carbon Types for Sale</h2>

        <h3>Powdered Activated Carbon (PAC)</h3>

        Powdered Activated Carbon is a fine carbon material with particle sizes typically less than 0.18 mm. Due to its
        high surface area and fast adsorption rate, PAC is ideal for removing organic compounds, chlorine, taste, and
        odor from water. <br><br>

        It is commonly used in drinking water purification, wastewater treatment, and industrial
        processes where quick and efficient contaminant removal is required.

        <h3>Granular Activated Carbon (GAC)</h3>
        Granular Activated Carbon consists of larger particles, offering excellent filtration performance and longer
        service life. <br><br>

        GAC is widely applied in continuous flow systems such as industrial water treatment filters and
        municipal purification systems. <br><br>

        Its larger particle size allows for better flow dynamics, reduced pressure drop,
        and ease of regeneration, making it suitable for both liquid and gas-phase applications.

        <h3>Extruded Activated Carbon (EAC)</h3>

        Extruded Activated Carbon, also known as pelletized activated carbon, is produced by combining powdered carbon
        with a binding agent and extruding it into cylindrical pellets. <br><br>

        EAC provides high mechanical strength, low dust
        generation, and uniform density. <br><br>

        It is ideal for air and gas purification, solvent recovery, and industrial
        water treatment systems where durability and low pressure loss are critical.
