        <h2>Activated Carbon Uses :</h2>

        <h3>Water Purification :</h3> Activated carbon is widely used in drinking water and wastewater
        treatment. It removes chlorine, bad odors, organic pollutants, and other impurities, improving water quality for
        household and industrial use.
        <br><br>

        <h3>Air and Gas Filtration:</h3> Used in air purifiers, industrial exhaust systems, and gas masks,
        activated carbon traps volatile organic compounds (VOCs), odors, and toxic gases, making the air safer to
        breathe.
        <br><br>

        <h3>Gold Recovery:</h3> In the mining industry, activated carbon plays a key role in gold extraction
        through processes like CIP, CIL, and CIC. Its high adsorption capacity allows efficient recovery of gold from
        cyanide solutions.
        <br><br>

        <h3>Food and Beverage Processing:</h3> Activated carbon is used to decolorize, purify, and remove
        unwanted tastes or odors from food and beverages such as sugar, wine, and juices.
        <br><br>

        <h3>Medical and Pharmaceutical:</h3> Activated carbon is used in emergency treatments for poisoning and
        drug overdoses, as well as in pharmaceutical manufacturing to purify raw ingredients and products.
        <br><br>

        <h3>Chemical Processing:</h3> In chemical industries, activated carbon filters impurities from raw
        materials, recovers solvents, and acts as a catalyst carrier in various reactions.
        <br><br>

        <h3>Cosmetics and Personal Care:</h3> Commonly found in facial masks, toothpaste, and soaps, activated
        carbon helps absorb toxins, oils, and impurities from the skin, promoting cleanliness and clarity.
        <br><br>
