        processed through
        high-temperature activation to create a highly porous structure. <br><br>


        Available in various forms including powder, granular, and carbon pellets. <br><br>
        
        It is widely used for water
        treatment, air purification, gold recovery, CO₂ adsorption, carbon capture, aquarium and reef tanks, food &
        beverage processing, medical uses for diarrhea and food poisoning, as well as advanced applications like
        supercapacitors.

        <h2>Activated Carbon for Sale</h2>

        <h3>Coconut Shell Based</h3>
        Activated carbon made from coconut shell is widely used due to its small pore structure. <br><br>
        
        This type is
        highly effective for drinking water purification and gold refining, making it popular in industries that require
        high purity <br><br>

        <h3>Wood Based</h3>
        Wood-based activated carbon has larger pores <br><br> 
        
        Making it ideal for decolorizing and purifying colored liquids
        such as sugar, syrup, or beverages. Its characteristics help improve clarity without affecting taste quality.
        <br><br>

        <h3>Coal Based</h3>
        This type is commonly used in large-scale industries. <br><br>
        
        Activated carbon from coal (bituminous or anthracite) is
        widely applied for gas filtration, wastewater treatment, and other heavy-duty applications due to its strong
        adsorption capacity.

        <h2>Powdered Activated Carbon (PAC) for Sale</h2>

        Powdered Activated Carbon (PAC) is a highly porous adsorbent material made from natural sources such as coconut
        shells, wood, or coal. <br><br>

        It is processed into a fine powder with a particle size of less than 0.18 mm, giving it a large surface area and
        rapid adsorption capability. <br><br>

        These pores significantly increase the total internal surface (up to 1500 m² per gram). <br><br>
        
        Allowing PAC to quickly
        trap and hold impurities such as organic compounds, chlorine, and unwanted taste or odor. <br><br>

        Applications:

        <ul class="ulStyle">
          <li><h3>Water Treatment</h3>Added directly into water treatment systems or mixed with water, then filtered out.
            Effective for removing odor, taste, chlorine, and harmful contaminants, including PFAS removal.</li>
          <li><h3>Aquarium & Fish Tank</h3>
            Sprinkled or packed into filter sheets to maintain water clarity in reef tanks,
            ponds, and aquariums, ensuring a healthy ecosystem.</li>
          <li><h3>Food & Beverage</h3>Activated carbon is widely used in the food and beverage industry, such as in sugar
            refining to remove color and odor from raw sugar liquor, in syrup production to ensure clarity and purity
          </li>
          <li><h3>Medical Use</h3>
            Consumed in powder or tablet form (suspended in water) as an emergency treatment for
            diarrhea, food poisoning, or poisoning in animals (e.g., dogs with ball belly). Must follow
            medical/veterinary instructions..</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Granular Activated Carbon (GAC)</h2>

        Larger granules that can be used in carbon filters or bags, and can be regenerated for multiple uses. <br><br>

        Applications & Usage:

        <ul class="ulStyle">
          <li><h3>Water Treatment</h3> Packed in filter columns or bags for household and industrial installations, ensuring
            effective
            purification of drinking water, ponds, and wastewater.</li>
          <li><h3>Air Purification</h3> Filled into cartridges or air filters to adsorb odors, gases, and harmful compounds in
            both
            residential and industrial settings.</li>
          <li><h3>Aquarium & Fish Tank</h3> 
            Placed inside filter media bags or cartridges, highly effective in maintaining water
            quality in aquariums, decorative ponds, and reef tanks. Needs regular replacement (2–4 weeks).</li>
          <li><h3>Gold Recovery</h3> Widely used in mining industries, where gold ions are adsorbed from cyanide solutions using
            carbon-in-pulp or carbon-in-leach methods.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Pellet / Extruded Activated Carbon (EAC)</h2>

        Shaped into small cylinders (carbon pellets) with high mechanical strength and resistance to pressure, ideal for
        gas and air flow applications. <br><br>

        Applications & Usage:

        <ul class="ulStyle">
          <li><h3>CO₂ Adsorption & Carbon Capture</h3> Used in carbon capture systems for greenhouse gas reduction and
            eco-friendly
            technologies.</li>
          <li><h3>Air & Gas Filtration</h3> Installed in industrial filters and purifiers for gases, solvents, and air pollution
            control.</li>
          <li><h3>Supercapacitors</h3> Processed into electrodes for modern energy storage due to its high electrical
            adsorption
            capacity.</li>
          <li>
            <h3>Industrial Applications</h3> Applied in chemical, petrochemical, and factory emission filtration where high
            mechanical strength is required.</li>
        </ul>
