        RBD Palm Oil high quality, consistent purity, and cost-effective performance make RBD Palm Oil an essential raw
        material
        for industries seeking reliable, efficient, and sustainable solutions in both food and non-food production.
        <br><br>

        Furthermore, RBD Palm Oil can be fractionated — a process of controlled cooling and separation — to obtain two
        main components:

        <h2><a href="./rbd-palm-olein.html" class="blue">a. RBD Palm Olein Oil</a></h2>

        The liquid fraction, which
        remains clear at room temperature and is widely used as a premium
        frying oil and cooking ingredient.

        <h2><a href="./rbd-palm-stearin.html" class="blue">b. RBD Palm Stearin</a></h2>

        is used in the production of margarine, shortening, bakery fats,
        soaps, candles, and other industrial products. <br><br>

        This fractionation process enhances the versatility of palm oil, allowing it to meet diverse market needs across
        both the food and non-food sectors. <br><br>
