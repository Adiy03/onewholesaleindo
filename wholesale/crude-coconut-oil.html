            Crude Coconut Oil (CCO) is a natural vegetable oil produced from copra (dried coconut meat) through pressing
            and initial refining processes.<br><br>

            Known for its high content of saturated fatty acids, particularly lauric acid

            This product is widely used as a <b>raw material</b> in various industries,
            including soap, margarine, shortening, cosmetics, and oleochemicals. <br><br>

        Unlike Virgin Coconut Oil (VCO), which is extracted directly from fresh coconut meat without excessive
        heating and retains the natural coconut flavor and aroma<br><br>

        <h2>Crude Coconut Oil (CCO) Uses:</h2>

        <strong>Soap & Detergent Production:</strong>
        CCO is widely used as a key ingredient in the manufacture of soaps and detergents, thanks to its high lauric
        acid content that produces excellent cleansing and foaming properties.<br><br>

        <strong>Food Industry:</strong>
        Crude Coconut Oil (CCO) serves as the raw material which, after undergoing refining, bleaching, and deodorizing
        (RBD), is transformed into a neutral, odorless, and colorless oil. <br><br>

        In this refined form (RBD Coconut Oil), it is
        widely used as cooking oil, margarine, shortening, and a versatile base for many processed food
        products.<br><br>

        <strong>Cosmetics & Personal Care:</strong>
        CCO is utilized in the production of lotions, creams, and hair care products, providing moisturizing and
        conditioning effects.<br><br>

        <strong>Oleochemicals:</strong>
        An essential raw material for producing fatty acids, fatty alcohols, surfactants, and other derivatives used in
        pharmaceuticals and industrial formulations.<br><br>

        <strong>Industrial Applications:</strong>
        CCO is also processed into biodiesel, lubricants, and other chemical products, making it a valuable commodity in
        the global energy and manufacturing sectors.

        <h2>Indonesia Crude Coconut Oil (CCO) Benefits:</h2>

        Crude Coconut Oil (CCO), derived from the dried kernel (copra) of mature coconuts (Cocos nucifera), is one of
        Indonesia’s most valuable agro-industrial commodities. <br><br>

        Naturally abundant in lauric acid and medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), it plays a vital role as a base
        ingredient for diverse applications spanning the food, cosmetic, pharmaceutical, and industrial sectors.
        <br><br>

        With its distinctive golden-yellow hue, mild coconut aroma, and versatile functionality, CCO is globally
        recognized as the essential raw material that undergoes further refining into RBD Coconut Oil or is processed
        into a wide variety of value-added products. <br><br>

        As one of the world’s leading coconut producers, Indonesia consistently delivers crude coconut oil that meets
        international quality standards, offering reliable supply and competitive value for global trade.
