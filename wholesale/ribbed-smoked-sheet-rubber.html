        <h2>Uses and Benefits of RSS (Ribbed Smoked Sheet Rubber)</h2>

        RSS (Ribbed Smoked Sheet Rubber) is a natural rubber product produced through a controlled process of latex
        coagulation, rolling, and smoking, resulting in durable sheets with strong elasticity and consistent mechanical
        properties. <br><br>

        It is widely used across tire manufacturing, automotive components, footwear, rubber goods, industrial parts,
        engineering applications, conveyor belts, hoses, and molded rubber products. <br><br>

        The benefits of RSS include excellent tensile strength, high elasticity, natural durability, strong abrasion
        resistance, good processability, and cost efficiency for mass production industries. <br><br>

        RSS also offers stable performance under pressure, flexibility for both heavy-duty and general applications, and
        environmentally friendly characteristics as a biodegradable natural material. <br><br>

        Its standardized grading system—RSS1 to RSS5—allows manufacturers to select the appropriate grade based on
        purity,
        color, strength, and industrial requirements, making RSS a reliable and versatile raw material for diverse
        sectors.
        <br><br>
