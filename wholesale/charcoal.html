        <h2>Types of Charcoal:</h2>

        <h3>a. Traditional Lump Charcoal</h3>
        Natural charcoal made directly from wood carbonization without additional binders or processing.

          <li><strong>Hardwood Lump Charcoal</strong> – Produced from dense tropical hardwoods such as mangrove, acacia,
            mahogany, and tamarind. Known for high heat, long burning, and low ash.</li>
          <li><strong>Binchotan (White Charcoal)</strong> – A premium Japanese-style charcoal, extremely dense, burns at
            very high temperatures, and produces almost no smoke or odor.</li>
          <li><strong>Coconut Shell Charcoal (Lump Form)</strong> – Made from carbonized coconut shells, burns cleanly,
            produces minimal smoke, and is highly valued for eco-friendliness.</li>
        </ul>

        <br>

        <h3>b. Processed Charcoal (Briquettes & Agglomerated Forms)</h3>

        Charcoal that is crushed, mixed with natural binders (such as tapioca starch), and compressed into uniform
        shapes.

        <ul class="ulStyle">

            heat, long burning, and uniform size.</li>
          <li><strong>Coconut Shell Briquettes</strong> – Popular for shisha/hookah and barbecues due to clean burn, low
            ash, and odorless performance.</li>

            cost-effectiveness and versatile fuel use.</li>
