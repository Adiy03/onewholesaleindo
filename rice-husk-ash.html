            <br>
            Rice Husk - Hull Ash (RHA) is a fine, powdery substance derived from the controlled combustion of rice
            husks, rich
            in silica and other minerals. <br><br>

            Widely used in construction, agriculture, and industrial applications, it enhances cement strength, improves
            soil health, and serves as a sustainable raw material. <br><br>

            Its eco-friendly nature and high silica content make RHA a valuable byproduct for industries seeking
            low-cost, green alternatives.
